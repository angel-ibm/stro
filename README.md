# Anomaly dection using Milvus, Presto and Kafka on a Lakehouse

![Top](./images/cover1.png "watsonxdata")

We all know that beautiful pictures often captivate us. However beauty may sometimes be deceiving. Let's take, for example, the night sky: a source of inspiration and wonder beneath the moonlight, yet it may conceal unseen dangers hidden in anomalies that we may be able to detect.

## A big family of use cases

There are numerous examples where anomaly detection is critical, not only for a company's success but also for the well-being of society. Some key areas include:

- Quality control in the automotive industry
- Detecting fabric defects in retail
- Surface deterioration in civil engineering
- Defect detection in electronics
- Assisted disease diagnosis and alike in life sciences
- ...and many more, such as in agriculture, surveillance, and beyond.

For this demo, the use case we will present is of monumental importance. Indeed, the threat it addesses could compromise the very existence of humanity: the detection of asteroids or near-Earth objects with potentially devastating consequences if a collision might occur.

Don't think about science fiction now, this is no kidding at all. In fact,  significant resources have been, and continue to be, invested in identifying potentially hazardous objects in space. Projects like the [NEO Surveyor](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/neo-surveyor/), the [Space Mision DART](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/dart/) , and the [Flyeye project](https://www.esa.int/ESA_Multimedia/Images/2016/10/Flyeye_telescope) are dedicated to detecting these threats and protecting the Eartht from potential risks.

As part of the global effort to spot risky celestial objects such as asteroids and comets, ESA is developing a network of automated telescopes for nightly sky surveys. The Flyeye-1 telescope is the first in a future network that would scan the entire sky and automatically identify possible new near-Earth objects (NEOs) for follow up and later checking by human astronomers.

## Objectives

The motivation of the demo is to illustrate how a group of technologies can be easily integrated  to extract valuable insights from the combination of graphical content and its metadata (with indepence of the use case or the industry area). It is not intended to represent an actual implementation of near-Earth object detection. No, astronomers do not operate exactly in this way. However, this is not an obstacle to learn how to how to effectively combine multiple technological components to achieve useful outcomes.

Consider a project that requires:

- Unstructured mass storage in a Lakehouse
- Extraction and management of content metadata
- Event generation and data transport
- Embedding generation and similarity search

Milvus, Kafka, Presto, Iceberg, Python are good technology candidates to address the requirements mentioned above. They are integrated and demonstrated in the following sections.  The demo is hosted in an environment created by IBMers called [watsonx.data Lab](https://ibm.github.io/watsonx-data-lab/) aimed at educating other IBMers, Business Partners, and anyone with access to the [IBM TechZone](https://ibm.github.io/watsonx-data-lab/).

![watsonxdata](./images/watsonxdata.png "watsonxdata")

 This environment extensively leverages the commercial product [watsonx.data](https://www.ibm.com/products/watsonx-data) which combines many technologies typically present in projects dedicated to analytics and artifical intelligence. Take a look at the [watsonx.data Solution Brief](https://www.ibm.com/downloads/cas/4Z1YXEBO) for more details on this product.

## The story

Professional and amateur astronomers often compare their observations (i.e: their own sky images) with established scientific databases that catalog all known celestial objects. Examples of these databases include [GAIA](https://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/gaia/), the [Horizons System](https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/horizons/) and the [Minor Planet Center](http://www.minorplanetcenter.net/about).  These systems house billions of entries and petabytes of data. Indeed, the universe is vast.

![Ergenzingen](./images/ergenzingen.png "ergenzingen")

When astronomers encounter an unidentified object, it's considered an anomaly. They continue to observe and calculate its trajectory to determine whether it poses any concern. These anomalies can range from insignificant issues like space debris, camera malfunctions or atmospheric interference to potentially significant discoveries such as previously unnoticed asteroids or comets. One example of a surveillance system used for this purpose is [Scout: NEOCP Hazard Assessment](https://cneos.jpl.nasa.gov/scout/intro.html).

### 1. Content generation: graphics and metadata

For the moment, let's remain more modest in our goals and assume that we have an amateur telescope pointing to the sky. The target for tonight is the [Andromeda Galaxy, aka. M31](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andromeda_Galaxy). At the naked eye, this object is six times bigger than the moon but it is really faint. That is: if you have a dark sky and if your eyes work well you may guess a faint, grey ellipse. Simple binoculars or a **wide field telescope** will give you a quite different perspective. Something like this:

![mym31](./images/mym31.png "mym31")

To get pictures, we attach a **deep space camera** to the telescope and connect the camera to small computer that acts as an **event generator**. Every time a picture is captured, the event lands onto our demo system bringing the graphic and metadata content. This looks like something like this:

![Conn](./images/connections.png "Conn")

Obviuosly, there are many cables that I am not showing in the picture and a few more components necessary to get a decent picture. Anyway, if you are curious take a look at some of them:

![Gear](./images/gear.png "Gear")

### 2. Content transport and storage

We need to store for some time the events until we are sure that can be disposed.

### 3. Similarity search and alert generation

Metadata help us to perform sensible searchs 


By the way: this schema can be generalized immediately to another use cases: think of **a drone looking for structural defects** in the surface of a bridge, or a **camera detecting imperfections** in  textile fabrics...
